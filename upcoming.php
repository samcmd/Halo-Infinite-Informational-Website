        <p>
            Although the "full game" has finally been released there is hopefully still much more to come to the game as the developers 
            have indicated. One staple part of the Halo series is still not in the game and that is co-op campaign which aloows one friend 
            to tag along on your adventure as Master Chief with you. This is to be released at some point next year with forge cominglater 
            that year. The forge is another classic element of Halo games which allows players to create custom games which can be played using 
            the online multiplayer system, greatly expaniding the multiplayer content in the game. As the multiplayer to the game is free, 
            Microsoft has decided to implement a battle pass system, essentially meaning a set of levels associated with new unlocks comes around 
            every three months or so which should lead to better customization options as the game is pretty barebones in that regard on launch. 
            One thing many players are hoping are coming to Halo as well areperformance fixes, as the game is now it runs poorly relativley to 
            other similarly demanding games on the same platform with frequent crash to desktop events on PC and networking errors kicking players 
            from multiplayer games and not registering attacks and movements correctly on the server. These particular issues really sour the otherwise 
            fairly excellent experience with the game so I would expect it to be a priority when it comes to future updates.
