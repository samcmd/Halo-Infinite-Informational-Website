        <h3>Campaign</h3>
        <p>
            The iconic Master Chief is back with no Cortana this time (he rolled back to Windows 7) and it's up 
            to him to stop the Banished from activating the superweapon known as Zeta Halo capable of destroying all life 
            in the universe. Equip your trusty sidekick pistol and get down to business to save the universe once again. 
            This time the Halo you play on has an open design allowing you to move across the expansive Zeta Halo with no 
            loading screens. This may be a shock for some who are habd to the much more linear missions of previous Halo games that
            were not all contained within the same map.

        <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
        <p>
            While the campaign might be a far different experience from previous Halo games, the multiplayer feels very similar to 
            the classic games in a good way. Right now there are 4 v 4 and 8 v 8 playlists to choose from with gamemodes such as: 
            Capture the Flag, Slayer, and Oddball. While the core Halo gameplay is the same besides new graphics, new maps, and new weapons 
            some other new features have also been added to the Halo multiplayer meta such as equipment items. These items spawn on the map 
            as powerups and give your Spartan an edge in combat that allows you to get creative with combat in other ways than 
            aim at head and shoot. For example, one equipment item is the repulsor which when habd sends an enemy, vehicle, or projectile 
            that is in front of the player, flying in the opposite direction. As you can imagine this can be habd very creatively 
            in order to triumph over the enemy.
